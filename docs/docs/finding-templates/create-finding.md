# Creating findings from templates
When creating new findings, you can select a template to use.
The contents of template fields are copied to a new finding.

The template searchbar searches in template tags and the titles of all template translations.
For example you can search for `xss` to find all templates containing the tag `xss` or the word `xss` in the title of any translation (English, German, etc.).

When selecting a template, you can select the language of the template to use.
By default the language of the pentest project is selected.
If no translation for the selected language is available, the main language of the template is used.
