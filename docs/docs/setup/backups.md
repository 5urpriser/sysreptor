## Create backups via CLI
:octicons-server-24: Self-Hosted

Backups can be created via a CLI command or an API request.
The backup archive contains a database export and all uploaded files.

Execute following command to create a backup:
```bash title="Create backup via CLI"
docker compose run --rm app python3 manage.py backup > backup.zip
```

Backups can be encrypted using a 256-bit AES key. 
Specify the key as hex string via the `--key` CLI argument.
```bash title="Create encrypted backup via CLI"
docker compose run --rm app python3 manage.py backup --key "<aes-key-as-hex>" > backup.zip.crypt
```




## Create backups via API
:octicons-cloud-24: Cloud Â· :octicons-server-24: Self-Hosted

### Prerequisites
Creating backups is a high-privilege operation. Therefore, access to the backup API endpoint is restricted.
Only [`superusers`](/setup/user-permissions/#superuser) [`system`-users](/setup/user-permissions/#system) can access this endpoint in combination with a `BACKUP_KEY`.
Regular users do not have access to the backup API endpoint.

Additionally, you need to configure a `BACKUP_KEY` as environment variable.
This backup key has to be at least 20 characters long.
If no `BACKUP_KEY` is configured, the backup API endpoint is disabled.

Optionally, the backup can be encrypted via a 256-bit AES key provided in the HTTP request body.

### API Requests
```
# Create backup
curl -X POST https://sysreptor.example.com/api/v1/utils/backup/ -d '{"key": "<backup-key>"}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-token>' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -o backup.zip

# Create encrypted backup
curl -X POST https://sysreptor.example.com/api/v1/utils/backup/ -d '{"key": "<backup-key>", "aes_key": "<aes-key-as-hex>"}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-token>' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -o backup.zip.crypt
```

## Restore backups
:octicons-server-24: Self-Hosted

Make sure that you have an empty database and empty data directories (i.e. empty docker volumes). Otherwise, you will **lose your old data**.
During the backup restore, all existing data in the database and file storages is deleted.

It is recommended to import the backup into the same SysReptor version like the one that was used to create the backup.
If a different version is used the database schema might not be compatible.

```bash title="Restore backup via CLI"
cat backup.zip | docker compose run --rm --no-TTY app python3 manage.py restorebackup
```

Encrypted backups can be restored as well. Specify the AES key as hex string via the `--key` CLI argument.
```bash title="Restore encrypted backup via CLI"
cat backup.zip.crypt | docker compose run --rm --no-TTY app python3 manage.py restorebackup --key "<aes-key-as-hex>"
```
