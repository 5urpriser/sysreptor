TODO EXECUTIVE SUMMARY HERE

{{ report.customer_short }} should create a remediation plan based on the [Remediation Summary](#remediation-summary) section of this report, addressing all high findings as soon as possible according to the needs of the business. {{ report.customer_short }} should also consider performing periodic vulnerability assessments if they are not already being performed. Once the issues identified in this report have been addressed, a more collaborative, in-depth Active Directory security assessment may help identify additional opportunities to harden the Active Directory environment, making it more difficult for attackers to move around the network and increasing the likelihood that {{ report.customer_short }} will be able to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
